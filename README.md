# scripts

This content is intended for those people who usually use a text editor (e.g.:
[vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor))) and want to
enhance/automate their programming.

## Usage
First, make sure the file scripting has executing right permission if it
doesn't do the following:
```
chmod +x <file>
```
Under terminal, simply type the script you want to create, e.g.:
```
mkcppmaintmpl <file_name>
```
If you do specify the <file_name>, then it's gonna prompt for you to insert.
```
mkcppmaintmpl [ENTER]
File name: main (there's no need to type the file extension)
Open file? [y/n]
```
